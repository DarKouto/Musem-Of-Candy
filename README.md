Blog-type website using Bootstrap 4's Grid System and Flexbox

This project is part of a Web Development course I took. This part focuses specifically on Bootstrap 4, and its Grid System and Flexbox.

The main goal was to create a fully resposive website, in which the content moves from one place to the other and eventually stacks underdeath as it narrows down, so it looks good on very user device.

It also features a Bootstrap 4 Navbar, which was custom-styled with CSS3, and a bit of JavaScript and jQuery for a simple animation.
